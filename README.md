# Express.js Route Parameter Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with route parameters in Express.js applications. The problem arises when unexpected characters or encoding issues affect how the parameters are parsed and used within the route handler.

## Problem Description

The provided code snippet shows a simple Express.js route handler designed to fetch user details based on a user ID passed as a route parameter.  However, it lacks proper handling of potentially problematic input, leading to errors if the user ID contains unexpected characters or is not properly encoded.

## Solution

The solution involves enhancing the route handler to properly sanitize and validate the route parameter before using it to access data or perform other operations. This ensures the application behaves correctly even with unusual or unexpected input, preventing errors and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send requests with various route parameters, including those with special characters or improper encoding, to observe the issue.
5. Then run `node bugSolution.js` and test again.
